# Codewars Solutions

A curated collection of my solutions to [Codewars](https://www.codewars.com) kata challenges, written in JavaScript and TypeScript.

This repository serves as a personal reference for problem-solving approaches and modern JavaScript/TypeScript patterns, showcasing clean, readable code that prioritizes clarity over cleverness.

## What's Inside

Each kata (challenge) lives in its own file, named using snake_case or camelCase to reflect the problem. Solutions emphasize:

- **Problem-solving practice**: Sharpening algorithmic thinking and pattern recognition
- **JavaScript & TypeScript exploration**: Learning language features and modern JS patterns
- **Code readability**: Writing maintainable solutions that others can understand

## Structure

Solutions are organized by difficulty level in separate directories:

```
8kyu/          # Beginner challenges
7kyu/          # Easy challenges
6kyu/          # Intermediate challenges
5kyu/          # Advanced challenges
4kyu/          # Expert challenges
```
