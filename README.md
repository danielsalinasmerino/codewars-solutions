## ðŸ“‚ Structure

Each kata (challenge) has its own file, named using snake_case or camelCase, indicating the problem. Some examples:

- `detect_pangram.ts` â€” Check if a given string is a pangram.  
- `descending_order.ts` â€” Rearrange digits in descending order.  
- `replace_with_alphabet_position.ts` â€” Replace letters with their respective alphabet positions.
